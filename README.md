## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information about upcoming opportunities such as residencies to apply for.
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.
        3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find community links.

    -   #### Frequent User Goals
        1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added opportunities, news or documentation of previous events.
        2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new blog posts.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The three main colours used are Untethered Magic neon pink, purple, and very dark chocolate.
    -   #### Typography
        -   Various heavier weights of Raleway font are used throughout the whole website for headings with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Designed by Vernon Adams, Oswald is used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices.
        -   Roboto font is the main body font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roboto is a clean font that has become increasingly popular on the web, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
        -   The cursive font Reenie Beanie is used for the navbrand logotype with Cursive and then Sans Serif as the fallback fonts in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. As the site is updated, an SVG file will be placed for the navbar brand that will incoporporate both the logo and the logotype.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.

        2. At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection call to action to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
        3. On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.
